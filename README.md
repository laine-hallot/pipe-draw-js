# PipeDrawJS (wip)

A program to make quick image mark up easy.

## Note

At the moment this is repo is almost completely undocumented and just generally a mess. A bunch of features aren't implemented yet and half and build system is broken.

## Usage

**You'll need to build the frontend and generate an electron binary first!!**
Just provide a png with stdin.

```sh
scrot --silent - | ./pipedrawjs
```
